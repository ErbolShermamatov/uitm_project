        description: 'Set in Japan during the Taisho Period, the story follows Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy who sells charcoal to support his family. One cold day, his peaceful life is shattered when he returns home to find his entire family slaughtered by a demon. The sole survivor is his younger sister, Nezuko, but she has been transformed into a ferocious demon herself. <br><br> However, unlike ordinary demons, Nezuko still shows signs of human emotion and thought, protecting her brother rather than attacking him. After a fateful encounter with Giyu Tomioka, a high-ranking swordsman, Tanjiro resolves to become a "Demon Slayer." <br><br>  Embarking on a perilous journey, Tanjiro trains to master the art of "Water Breathing" swordsmanship. His goal is twofold: to hunt down the demon responsible for the massacre and to find a cure to turn his beloved sister back into a human. Along the way, he joins the Demon Slayer Corps and forms an unlikely team with fellow slayers to battle the powerful forces of the night.',
